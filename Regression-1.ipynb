    "Multicollinearity is a phenomenon in multiple linear regression where two or more independent variables in a model are highly correlated.

In the presence of multicollinearity, it becomes challenging to isolate the individual effect of each predictor on the dependent variable.\n",

    "4. Eigenvalues of the Correlation Matrix:\n",
    "Evaluate the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix. If there are eigenvalues close to zero, it suggests multicollinearity.\n",

    "Use feature selection techniques to select a subset of the most relevant variables and exclude the redundant ones.\n",
    "3. Regularization Techniques:\n",
