    "#### Traditional Web Hosting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional web hosting refers to the practice of hosting a website or application on a single physical server or a limited number of servers within a specific data center. In this model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Server Ownership:\n",
    "\n",
    "Organizations typically own or lease dedicated physical servers or rent shared hosting space from a hosting provider. These servers are located in a specific physical location.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Scalability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability is limited to the capacity of the physical server. If additional resources or computing power are required, organizations need to invest in new hardware or upgrade existing servers.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Server Ownership:\n",
    "\n",
    "Organizations do not own physical servers. Instead, they rent virtual server instances and other computing resources from a cloud service provider. These resources are hosted across a distributed network of data centers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Scalability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud hosting offers on-demand scalability. Organizations can easily scale resources up or down based on actual usage, paying only for the resources consumed. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for handling varying levels of traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Infrastructure Management:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud providers handle infrastructure management, including server maintenance, security, and networking. This allows organizations to focus on application development and business operations rather than infrastructure management.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Cost Structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud hosting typically follows a pay-as-you-go or pay-per-usage cost structure. Organizations are billed based on the resources they consume, making it a more cost-effective option, especially for applications with fluctuating workloads.\n",
