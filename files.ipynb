    "This mode is used to open a file for writing. If the file exists, its contents will be truncated (emptied). If the file does not exist, a new file will be created. The file pointer is positioned at the beginning of the file.\n",
    "Example: file = open(\"example.txt\", 'w')\n",
    "\n",
    "'a' (Append mode):\n",
    "This mode is used to open a file for appending data. If the file exists, the new data will be added to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created. The file pointer is positioned at the end of the file.\n",
    "Example: file = open(\"example.txt\", 'a')\n",

    "\n",
    "'t' (Text mode):\n",
    "This mode is used to open a file in text mode, which is the default mode. In this mode, the file is read or written as a text file, and the data is represented as strings.\n",
    "Example: file = open(\"example.txt\", 'r')\n",
    "\n",
    "'b' (Binary mode):\n",
    "This mode is used to open a file in binary mode. In this mode, the file is read or written as a binary file, and the data is represented as bytes. Binary mode is used for non-text files like images, audio, video, etc.\n",

    "The close() function is used to close a file that has been opened using the open() function in Python\n",
    " It is important to close a file for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 . Release system resources: When a file is opened, the   operating system allocates certain resources to handle the file operations, such as reading or writing data. These resources are limited, and if they are not released properly, it can lead to resource leaks. Closing the file using close() ensures that these system resources are freed up and made available for other processes or operations. \n",
    "2 . Flush data to disk: When data is written to a file, it is initially stored in a buffer, and it is not immediately written to the disk. Closing the file with close() ensures that any remaining data in the buffer is flushed and written to the disk. This guarantees that all the data is properly saved in the file.\n",
    "3 . Avoid data corruption: Closing a file properly helps prevent data corruption or loss. If a file is not closed and the program terminates abruptly or encounters an error, the file may remain in an inconsistent or incomplete state.Closing the file ensures that all the necessary operations are completed and the file is left in a consistent state.\n",
    "4 . Allow other processes to access the file: When a file is opened, it may be locked for exclusive access by the opening process. Closing the file releases this lock and allows other processes or programs to access the file."
