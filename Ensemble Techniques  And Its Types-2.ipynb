    "Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) reduces overfitting in decision trees through the following mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Diversity: \n",
    "Bagging generates multiple bootstrap samples (random subsets with replacement), leading to diverse training datasets for each base learner. This diversity helps reduce overfitting caused by individual trees memorizing the noise in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Averaging: \n",
    "The final prediction in bagging is obtained by averaging (for regression) or voting (for classification) the predictions of individual trees. This ensemble averaging smoothens out the variance associated with individual trees, resulting in a more robust and generalized model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Reduction of Variance: \n",
    "By combining the predictions of multiple trees, bagging reduces the variance of the model. It provides a more stable and less sensitive prediction, making the model less prone to overfitting to the training data."
