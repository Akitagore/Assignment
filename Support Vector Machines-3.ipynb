Both MSE and RMSE measure the average squared difference between predicted and actual values, with RMSE being the square root of MSE.\n",

    "1. MSE (Mean Squared Error):\n",

    "####### Advantages: It penalizes larger errors more heavily than smaller errors, providing a more sensitive measure of performance.\n",

    "####### Advantages: RMSE has the advantage of being in the same unit as the target variable, making it more interpretable.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Use MSE when:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You want a metric that emphasizes and penalizes larger errors more.\n",
    "2. Your goal is to minimize the squared differences between predicted and actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use RMSE when:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You prefer a metric that is in the same unit as the target variable, providing a more interpretable measure.\n",
    "2. You want a metric that considers both the magnitude and the scale of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since you mentioned that both MSE and RMSE values are very close, it suggests that the choice between them may not significantly impact your evaluation. You can choose the metric that aligns better with the interpretability requirements of your analysis or use both for a comprehensive assessment of your SVM regression model's performance."
