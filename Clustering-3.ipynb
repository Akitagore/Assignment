    "Basic Concept of Clustering:\n",
    "Clustering is a technique in machine learning and data analysis that involves grouping similar data points into clusters. The goal is to ensure that data points within the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters. Clustering helps uncover hidden patterns, structure, or relationships in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of Applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Customer Segmentation: Cluster customers based on their purchasing behavior to tailor marketing strategies.\n",
    "2. Document Clustering: Group similar documents together for efficient organization and retrieval.\n",
    "3. Image Segmentation: Identify and group pixels with similar characteristics in images.\n",
    "4. Anomaly Detection: Detect unusual patterns or outliers in datasets.\n",
    "5. Genomic Data Analysis: Cluster genes based on expression patterns to identify functional relationships.\n",
    "6. Network Security: Identify clusters of network activities to detect potential security threats.\n",
