    "1. Euclidean Distance: Measures the straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space.\n",

    "####  Effect on KNN:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Euclidean distance considers diagonal movements, while Manhattan distance only considers horizontal and vertical movements.\n",
    "2. The choice of distance metric impacts the shape of decision boundaries in KNN.\n",
    "3. In KNN classifier/regressor, if the features have different scales, Euclidean distance might be influenced more by features with larger scales."
