    "Linear regression is used for predicting a continuous outcome, while logistic regression is employed for binary classification problems. The key distinction lies in the type of dependent variable. Linear regression models the relationship between independent variables and a continuous target, whereas logistic regression models the probability of an event occurring, outputting values between 0 and 1. Logistic regression is more suitable when dealing with binary outcomes, such as predicting whether a student passes or fails an exam."

Optimization is typically achieved using iterative algorithms like gradient descent or more advanced methods. These algorithms adjust the model parameters iteratively to minimize the difference between predicted probabilities and actual outcomes."

Regular model evaluation and diagnostics, such as checking for residuals, can help identify and address issues during the implementation of logistic regression."
